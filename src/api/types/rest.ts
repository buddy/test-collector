     * Import test session from JUnit XML file(s) using suite token authentication
     * @description Import a test session by uploading one or more JUnit XML files. This endpoint accepts multipart/form-data with test report files and optional metadata fields.
     *
     *     **Authentication:** Include the suite token in the header: `Authorization: Bearer <suite_token>`
     *
     *     The endpoint automatically parses JUnit XML format, extracts test groups (test suites) and test cases, and creates a complete test session with all results.
     *
     *     **Example using curl:**
     *     ```bash
     *     curl -X POST https://api.buddy.works/unit-tests/import \
     *       -H "Authorization: Bearer bud_ut_us_..." \
